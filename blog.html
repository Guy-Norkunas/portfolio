                                <p>Red Tail Sharks have a deep black body with bright red tail fins that really give them an exotic look.

                                    These fish are very active and can be aggressive. They won’t physically attack other fish but do enjoy chasing them so make sure you provide plenty of hiding spots.
                                    
                                    The minimum tank size for these fish is 55-gallons and the can grow to be about six inches long. They like an environment with significant water flow and are skilled jumpers who require a weighted tank lid.</p>

                                <p>Cichlids are one of the most diverse groups of fish in the world. In fact, it’s estimated that there could be more than 2000 types of cichlids but the African Cichlid is one of the most exotic and colorful types out there.

                                    These fish come in all kinds of colors but tend to be brighter during mating or when they’re being aggressive.
                                    
                                    African Cichlids like habitats with moving water and a lot of rocks and caves to explore. They also like to dig so a soft substrate is best.</p>

                                <p>Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes from the subfamily Amphiprioninae in the family Pomacentridae. Thirty species are recognized: one in the genus Premnas, while the remaining are in the genus Amphiprion. In the wild, they all form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones. Depending on species, anemonefish are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. The largest can reach a length of 17 cm (6.7 in), while the smallest barely achieve 7–8 cm (2.8–3.1 in).</p>

                                <p>It’s no surprise that rainbow fish are colorful. Their iridescent scales change color as the light reflects off of them which makes them really fun to watch.


                                    These fish prefer a heavily planted environment with enough open space for them to swim freely.
                                    
                                    These are a schooling fish and should be kept in groups of at least six. They thrive in shoals of 10 or more.
                                    
                                    If they’re kept in small groups, they become shy and may even lose their coloring. As for temperament, they’re extremely peaceful and are a great choice for a community tank.</p>

                                <p>The ocean sunfish or common mola (Mola mola) is one of the heaviest known bony fishes in the world. Adults typically weigh between 247 and 1,000 kg (545–2,205 lb). The species is native to tropical and temperate waters around the world. It resembles a fish head with a tail, and its main body is flattened laterally. Sunfish can be as tall as they are long when their dorsal and ventral fins are extended.</p>
